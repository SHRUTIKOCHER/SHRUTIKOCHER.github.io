<h1>JOURNEY OF MY LIFE </h1>

<p>I conclude that life isnt meant to be understood but lived ,you might be thinking that why this blog starts with a conclusion ? Well,thats because i am going to talk about my joirney in rest of the pages  you might find it boring or might love it but wanted to make sure that eveyone takes the best of this blog , hence the conclusion first ! Today when i have decided to write about my life , i am struggling to think where to start with as thankfully my life is full of experiences , some are good and some are not . I am thankful to the god for the beuatiful moments in my life which i had spend with the people i loved and also lost then . The journey continued and even my blogs will continue  mow onwards . I am thankful now for the hurt and pain i got becuase without it , my joirney of experincig world would be incomplete . pain and happiness are are the two sides of coins and one is incomplte without the other , its the same way the tree is incomplte without its roots , the sorrows and pain are like roots and they make us think deeper and stay grounded and conncets tto the source at highly spritual level .So experience both and dont be scared ! at the end no one comes alive out of this life . Stay motivated and inculcate the habit to being passinate ! Lets look at the bright side of the coin  and being with some memorable moments of my life </P>
    <P>Tommorow I will come up with some wonderful moments of my life ! till then stay happy and feel blessed </P>
